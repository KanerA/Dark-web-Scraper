# Dark Web Scraper

## The project - 
The challenge - created by [IntSights](https://intsights.com/) - was assigned to me as part of the fullstack course of scale-up velocity.  
This scraper's goal is to give the ordinary user, access to dark web data.
It's actively going through the dark-web paste website - [Paste Stronghold](http://nzxj65x32vh2fkhk.onion/all), which can't be accessed with the regular chrome/firefox browser.  
Another use of this project is gathering information,
saving the data for analysis - hopefully a feature that will be added in the near future.

##  Start the scraper -
1. Clone this repository.

2. Then run - 
```bash
docker-compose up
```
 (You need to have Docker installed on your machine).

### After launching the docker-compose network, go to localhost:80 on your browser.
